//    Pigeon-Hole principle
//    Gray code : two consecutive numbers will have only one bit different in their binary representation, for example - 1101 & 1001
//    So the xor of two consecutive numbers in gray code will have only one 1 in it.

    // if N >= 130, we will have 65 pairs (with only one set bit). Each int is 64 bit and hence one place will have 2 bits because numbers are 65.
    // if N < 130 then apply brute-force

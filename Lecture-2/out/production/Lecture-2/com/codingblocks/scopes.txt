Scopes:
In Java, the two major scopes are those defined by a class and those defined by a method.
The scope defined by a method begins with its opening curly brace.
However, if that method has parameters, they too are included within the methodâ€™s scope.
Indeed, the scope rules provide the foundation for encapsulation.

Variables are created when their scope is entered, and destroyed when their scope is left.
Therefore, variables declared within a method will not hold their values between calls to that method.
Also, a variable declared within a block will lose its value when the block is left.
Thus, the lifetime of a variable is confined to its scope.
Although blocks can be nested, you cannot declare a variable to have the same name as one in an outer scope.

String -> HashCode -> Index

NOTE: The Hashcode is not the index in the Array!
We actually map from the key to the hashcode to the index, i.e. a hashcode maps towards the index.
This is because say our array may not be of greater size (as Hashcode can be large hence no point in making it index)

Two or more Strings can have the same hashcode, hence they will get added at the same index. This is called COLLISION.
We can remove collision by different methods.
One way is chaining i.e. Make an array of Linked lists.

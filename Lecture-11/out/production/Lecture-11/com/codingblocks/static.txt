Understanding static:

When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created,
and without reference to any object. You can declare both methods and variables to be static.
The most common example of a static member is main( ).
main( ) is declared as static because it must be called before any objects exist.
Static method in Java is a method which belongs to the class and not to the object.

A static method can access only static data. It cannot access non-static data (instance variables)
A non-static member belongs to an instance. It's meaningless without somehow resolving which instance of a class you
are talking about. In a static context, you don't have an instance, that's why you can't access a non-static member
without explicitly mentioning an object reference.
n fact, you can access a non-static member in a static context by specifying the object reference explicitly :
public class Human {

    String message = "Hello World";

    public static void display(Human human){
        System.out.println(human.message);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Human kunal = new Human();
        kunal.message = "Kunal's message";
        Human.display(kunal);
    }

}

A static method can call only other static methods and cannot call a non-static method from it.
A static method can be accessed directly by the class name and doesnâ€™t need any object
A static method cannot refer to "this" or "super" keywords in anyway

If you need to do computation in order to initialize your static variables,
you can declare a static block that gets executed exactly once, when the class is first loaded.

// Demonstrate static variables, methods, and blocks.
     class UseStatic {
       static int a = 3;
       static int b;
       static void meth(int x) {
         System.out.println("x = " + x);
         System.out.println("a = " + a);
         System.out.println("b = " + b);
       }
       static {
         System.out.println("Static block initialized.");
         b = a * 4;
        }
       public static void main(String args[]) {
         meth(42);
    }
}

As soon as the UseStatic class is loaded, all of the static statements are run. First, a is set to 3,
then the static block executes, which prints a message and then initializes b to a*4 or 12. Then main( ) is called,
which calls meth( ), passing 42 to x. The three println( ) statements refer to the two static variables a and b,
as well as to the local variable x.

Here is the output of the program:
Static block initialized. x = 42
a= 3
b = 12
Note: main method is static,since it must be accessible for an application to run, before any instantiation takes place.

Static methods can be inherited.
Static methods can be overridden.
Static INTERFACE METHODS are not inherited by either an implementing class or a subinterface.
